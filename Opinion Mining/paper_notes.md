## Debiasing Generative Named Entity Recognition by Calibrating Sequence Likelihood

### Research Question:
How can we **alleviate the bias** introduced by the Seq2Seq formulation in Named Entity Recognition (NER) by redistributing the likelihood among candidate sequences, rather than assigning all probability mass to the observed sequence?

### Scope

Seq2Seq formulation

### Contributions:
- 

### Criticisms/Limitations:
- RerankNER conducts calibration after the regular training, which introduces extra computational overhead.

### Further Improvement

Investigate the use of **few-shot learning** as a finetuning approach for pretrained language models to enhance efficiency without compromising performance.

### Thoughts:
