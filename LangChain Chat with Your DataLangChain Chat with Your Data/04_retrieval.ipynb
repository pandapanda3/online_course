    "# Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval is the centerpiece of our retrieval augmented generation (RAG) flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores and implements various document retrieval and optimization techniques using LangChain's vector storage and retrieval abstractions. The main objectives are to retrieve relevant documents effectively and enhance response quality by combining multiple advanced retrieval strategies. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key tasks and methods applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector-Based Similarity Search**:\n",
    "   - Uses `Chroma` for vector storage, with `OpenAIEmbeddings` to convert text into embeddings.\n",
    "   - Demonstrates similarity search to retrieve documents most similar to a query.\n",
    "   - Introduces **Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)** to achieve diverse and relevant search results by balancing relevance with diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metadata-Driven Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - Adds metadata filtering to refine searches by limiting results to specific sources or attributes.\n",
    "   - Explores **SelfQueryRetriever** to automatically infer metadata filters from natural language queries, enhancing retrieval specificity without needing additional manual filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contextual Compression**:\n",
    "   - Applies **ContextualCompressionRetriever** to extract only query-relevant sections from long documents.\n",
    "   - Combines document compression with **MMR** to ensure results are concise, focused, and varied, especially useful in handling long and multi-topic documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alternative Retrieval Methods**:\n",
    "   - Implements non-vector-based methods like **TF-IDF** and **SVM** for document retrieval, showing flexibility in retrieval strategies.\n",
    "   - **TF-IDF**: Ranks documents based on term frequency and inverse document frequency, suitable for keyword-based matching.\n",
    "   - **SVM**: Uses Support Vector Machine classification for scenarios where labeled data is available for training, enabling relevant vs. non-relevant document classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how to effectively retrieve, filter, and compress relevant document content for optimized responses. It leverages vector embeddings, metadata filtering, compression techniques, and alternative retrieval methods to handle various types of retrieval tasks, balancing specificity, relevance, and response efficiency. This approach is particularly useful for applications that require precise and diverse information retrieval from large document collections.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**: Load `Chroma` for vector storage and `OpenAIEmbeddings` to generate text embeddings.\n",
    "2. **Initialize Vector DB**: Set up `vectordb` to persist vectors in `'docs/chroma/'` using `OpenAIEmbeddings`.\n",
    "3. **Check Collection Count**: Display current entry count in `vectordb`.\n",
    "4. **Define Text Data**: Create sample texts describing *Amanita phalloides* for testing.\n",
    "5. **Create Small DB**: Use `Chroma.from_texts` to store sample texts in `smalldb` as embeddings.\n",
    "6. **Define Query**: Write a question about \"all-white mushrooms with large fruiting bodies.\"\n",
    "7. **Similarity Search**: Use `smalldb.similarity_search` to find the top 2 relevant documents based on the query.\n",
    "8. **Max Marginal Relevance Search**: Use `smalldb.max_marginal_relevance_search` to retrieve diverse yet relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of `vectordb` and `smalldb` Count Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issue**: After executing `smalldb = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embedding=embedding)`, the result of `print(vectordb._collection.count())` remains 209, without the 3 new text entries.\n",
    "- **Reason**: `smalldb` is a separate database instance and is not connected to `vectordb`. The `from_texts` method creates a new database (`smalldb`) without modifying `vectordb`.\n",
    "- **Solution**: To add the new texts directly to `vectordb`, use `vectordb.add_texts(texts)` and then check the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the document count in `vectordb` increases, showing 212.\n",
