# Motor Carriers

## Motor Carrier Industry Structure
- **According to the American Trucking Association (ATA)**:
  - Trucks moved approximately 67% of the nation's freight by weight.
  - Around 3 million class 8 trucks are used for business purposes.
  - About 6 million commercial trailers are registered.

- **According to the US Department of Transportation (2010)**:
  - 1.3 million total trucking companies.
  - 408,782 for-hire carriers.
  - 662,544 private carriers.
  - 168,680 other interstate motor carriers.

- **Small Business Dominance**:
  - 90.2% of companies operate 6 or fewer trucks.
  - 97.2% operate fewer than 20 trucks.

- **Economic Importance**:
  - The trucking industry supports around 7 million jobs related to trucking activities.
  - Approximately 3 million individuals are employed as truck drivers.

## Basic Operations

### Truckload (TL)
- Direct delivery from shipper to consignee.
- Average distance is 242 miles.
- Typically handled by many small carriers.
- Shipment weight ranges from 20,000 to 50,000 lbs.

### Less-than-Truckload (LTL)
- Picked up, moved to a terminal, reloaded for line-haul, delivered to terminal, and locally delivered.
- Average distance is about 550 miles.
- Requires a national or regional network.
- Shipment weight ranges from 50 to 10,000 lbs.
- Around 150 carriers handle LTL shipments.

### Parcel
- Includes home/business pickup, consolidation, sorting, and delivery to distribution centers and final destinations.
- Shipment weight ranges from 1 to 150 lbs.
- Fast, suitable for time-sensitive goods.
- Generally more expensive due to complex handling and logistics.

## Competition
- **Primary Competitive Factor**: Price differentiation.
- **Cost Structure**:
  - High variable costs (70-90%) and low fixed costs (10-30%).
- **Government Support**: Investment in highway infrastructure benefits the industry.
- **Terminal Costs**: Not capital intensive.
- **Operating Cost**: In the US, the operating cost ranges from $1.20 to $1.80 per mile.
- **Fuel Surcharges**: Carriers often apply fuel surcharges to recover fuel costs.
# Flying Freight

## Air Freight Service Characteristics
- **When Speed is Key**: Air freight is attractive when speed is more important than cost.
  - Common for **emergency shipments**.
  - Typical commodities include **mail**, **communications products**, **racehorses**, etc.

- **Speed of Service Considerations**:
  - Speed and travel time advantages can be offset by **flight frequency** and **timing**.
  - Smaller communities often experience **reduced service frequencies**.
  - Utilizes **hub-and-spoke networks**, leading to indirect routing.

## Cost Structure
- **High Variable Costs**: 70-90% of costs are variable, with only 10-30% being fixed.
  - Supported by government investment in highway structure.
  - Terminals are generally **not capital intensive**.

- **Breakdown of High Variable Costs**:
  - **Flight Operations**: Approximately 30%.
  - **Maintenance**: Around 12%.
  - **Aircraft and Traffic Servicing**: About 17%.

- **Fuel Costs Management**:
  - Fuel cost increases have a major impact on operating expenses.
  - Solutions include using **more fuel-efficient aircraft** and **smaller planes** on routes with lower density.

## Types of Equipment
- Different planes are used for specific purposes.

### All Cargo Planes
  - **Extra-large planes**.
  - **Wide body** aircraft.
  - **Narrow body** aircraft.

### Belly Cargo
  - Utilizes **existing airliners**.
  - Suitable for **smaller loads** (often only a few containers).

# Air Carriers

## Operations
- **All-Cargo Airlines**: Operate similarly to Truckload (TL) services, where the entire plane is rented.
- **Commercial Airlines**: Can carry smaller quantities as belly cargo, similar to Less-than-Truckload (LTL).
- **Parcel Carriers**: Use planes for small shipments, but these are often very expensive.

## Rates
- Air transportation rates are typically quoted by weight, but the actual rate is based on the **volumetric density** (density of the package).
- **Rate Adjustments Based on Density**:
  - If the package is less dense, charges are based on the volume translated to the corresponding weight.
  - If the package is heavier, charges are based on the actual weight.

## Competition
- **Fuel Costs**: Companies compete on who can manage fuel expenses best and hedge against future price increases.
- **Security Delays**: Managing delays due to security is another area of competition, with technology aiding in reducing these issues.
# Containers on a Train

## What is Intermodal?
- Intermodal transportation involves using containers that can seamlessly move between different modes of transport (e.g., truck to rail) without unloading the cargo.
- The key feature of intermodal is the container's ability to remain untouched while switching transportation modes, optimizing both time and cost.
- It is particularly effective when shipping full containers, allowing for more efficient transportation.

## Advantages of Intermodal Transportation
- **Cost Efficiency**: For long distances, rail transportation is more fuel-efficient than trucks, resulting in significant cost savings.
- **Speed**: Over long distances (more than 500 miles), rail is not much slower than trucks, making it a competitive option.
- **Accessibility**: By combining rail and truck transport, intermodal freight can reach nearly any destination accessible by trucks.
# Express Delivery

## Different Modes Used by Express Delivery Firms
1. **Rail**: Cheapest option and reasonably fast for long distances.
2. **Motor**: Ideal for short distances; provides fast pickup and delivery services everywhere.
3. **Air**: Fastest mode; cost-effective for specific high-priority items.

## General Purpose of Terminals
1. To receive shipments from across their network.
2. To send individual packages directly to customers.
3. To collect individual packages from shippers.
4. To route packages to their destinations efficiently.
# Comparison of Transportation Modes

## Speed
- **Truck**: Approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour on highways, ideal for distances up to 500 miles (800 kilometers).
- **Train**: Around 30 miles (50 kilometers) per hour, suitable for almost any distance.
- **Air**: Up to 200 miles (320 kilometers) per hour for distances over 500 miles (800 kilometers), including ground operations.

## Distance
- **Truck**: Ideal for distances up to 500 miles (800 kilometers), but can be used up to 750 miles (1200 kilometers) with some advantage.
- **Train**: More efficient for distances over 750 miles, with intermodal distances averaging around 1,700 miles.
- **Air**: Typically used for distances over 500 miles (800 kilometers), but more common for distances over 2,000 miles.

## Cost
- **Truck**: Highly variable rates; around $1.50 per mile is a reasonable starting rate for a TL shipment.
- **Rail**: Intermodal freight is generally cheaper than TL shipments, typically costing around 60-80% of a TL shipment.
- **Air**: Air freight is significantly more expensive, typically about 6 to 8 times the cost of truck transportation.
